# Debugging

## Overview

This directory focuses on debugging common programming errors using ChatGPT as a support tool. The objective is to understand how artificial intelligence can assist in identifying bugs, analyzing their causes, and proposing effective fixes across different code samples.

The tasks in this directory involve examining faulty code, correcting logical and runtime errors, and improving overall code reliability.

---
## Objectives

- Practice identifying and fixing bugs in code.
- Use ChatGPT to assist in debugging and error analysis.
- Understand common programming mistakes and how to avoid them.
- Improve code readability and correctness after debugging.

---

## Tasks Description

Each file in this directory contains code with one or more errors. The goal is to:

- Analyze the issue causing the program to fail or behave incorrectly.
- Apply appropriate fixes while maintaining clean and readable code.
- Test the corrected code to ensure it behaves as expected.

---

## Tools and Technologies

- Python 3
- Bash
- HTML / JavaScript
- ChatGPT (for debugging assistance)

---

## Important Notes

- All changes should be tested before submission.
- ChatGPT suggestions must be reviewed and verified.
- Understanding the fix is more important than applying it blindly.
